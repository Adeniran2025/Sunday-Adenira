    <p>The luxury car brand is named Rolls-Royce, not "Rose Royce." It was founded by
         <b>Sir Henry Royce and Charles Rolls</b>. The company name is a combination of their last names, 
         and the pair are credited with inventing the first car of the Rolls-Royce brand in 1904. 
         Sir Henry Royce.
 <b>Background:</b> An engineer with a modest upbringing, Royce was known for his relentless pursuit of perfection and engineering excellence.
    Contribution: He built his first car in 1904 and aimed to improve on the vehicles of the time. His car was later described by his partner as the best he had ever driven.

         Range Rover – Charles Spencer King (Spen King)
Charles Spencer King, a British engineer born in 1925, worked for the Rover Company. 
Passionate about blending comfort with off-road ability, he developed the first Range Rover in 1970.
 It was unique—a car that could drive through rough terrain like a Land Rover but also feel stylish and smooth on city roads. 
 His invention became a global icon of luxury SUVs, loved by royalty and adventurers alike.
